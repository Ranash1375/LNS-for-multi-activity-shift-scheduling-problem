# LNS-for-multi-activity-shift-scheduling-problem

Implemented the large neighborhood search (LNS) algorithm for the multi-activity shift scheduling problem as proposed in the paper:

Quimper, C.-G., & Rousseau, L.-M. (2010). A large neighbourhood search approach to the multi-activity shift scheduling problem. Journal of Heuristics, 16(3), 373â€“392.

A detailed description of the problem, along with examples, is provided in the accompanying PDF file.
